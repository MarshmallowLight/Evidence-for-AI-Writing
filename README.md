# Evidence-for-AI-Writing

This repository serves as evidence for the review conducted by Dahk to be AI-generated. The repository includes the results from five AI detection tools, which are visually documented in the "Screenshot" folder, with some providing detailed reports available in the "Report" folder. The findings from these tools are as follows:
